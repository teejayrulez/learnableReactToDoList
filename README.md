# React TO-DO-LIST
I used react to render a simple to-do-list.

### How the code work
1. On your terminal enter "npm start"
2. This will launch your browser and it will display
3. You can add, edit and delete your task
4. You can click on the task to mark it out

### Feautures 
1. Components
2. State Management: The application uses React Hooks (useState) for managing state. It maintains state for the list of todo items (todos), error messages (error), and the task content being edited (value).
3. Unique IDs: It uses the uuid library (uuidv4 function) to generate unique IDs for each todo item.
4. Operations: Users can add new todo items, mark todo items as completed or incomplete, delete todo items, and edit existing todo items.
5. Styling
